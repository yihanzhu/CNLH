4. On the top of the page, there are two TCP/IP models for the sender and the receiver.
5. The highlighted/red tab is the protocol that the student needs to implement
6. On the left side, the student needs to implement the "Sending" part of the functionality (i.e. Adding the header for the datagram to pass to the layer below)
7. On the right side, the student needs to implement the "Receiving" part of the functionality (i.e. Removing the header for the datagram to pass to the layer above)
8. The student needs to compile the C source code (.c file) into a object file (.o file)
9. Upload the object file to the server
10. Once the object file is uploaded, the highlighted tab turns to Yellow.
